You will be using this environment in the workshop. My Domain must be deployed in your environment in order to complete the Programmatic exercises. 

1. Sign up for [Lightning Now Tour Workshop developer org](https://developer.salesforce.com/promotions/orgs/lightningnow/).
2. When you receive your Signup confirmation email, Login to your new org and set your password. 
3. Define your Domain name in your Lightning Adoption Workshop Org
	1. From Setup, enter My Domain in the `Quick Find` box, then select **My Domain**.
	2. Enter the subdomain name you want to use within the sample URL. For example, if a company called Universal Containers uses the subdomain `universalcontainers`, the company’s login URL is `https://universalcontainers.my.salesforce.com/`. Your name can include up to 40 letters, numbers, and hyphens.
	You can’t use these reserved words for subdomains:
		1. www
		2. salesforce
		3. heroku
		4. You can’t start the domain name with:
		5. root
		6. status
		7. a hyphen (-)
	3. Click **Check Availability**. If your name is already taken, choose a different one.
	4. Click **Register Domain**.
	5. You receive an email when your domain name is ready for testing. This can take a few minutes.
   	6. The new subdomain is only available after you **test** and **deploy** it. When you receive the “Your Domain is Ready for Testing” email, go to **Setup** > **My Domain** > and select **Log in** to test your new domain. 
	7. Once you have used the **Log In** button to test your domain, you can deploy to your users by selecting the **Deploy to Users** button and then clicking **OK**. This makes your domain available and also enables you to use Custom and Managed components to build in Lightning!

4. **Save** this image locally as a JPG, it will be used later for an App logo in the workshop.
